Two processors control 8 microphones
Specially developed by Sony, the new Integrated Processor V1 unlocks the full potential of our HD Noise Canceling Processor QN1. This unique combination of technology controls 8 microphones to deliver unprecedent noise canceling quality.
Noise Cancellation
From airplane noise to people’s voices, our WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones keep out more high and mid frequency sounds than ever. And with Auto NC Optimizer, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment.
All day power and quick charging
With up to 40 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power even for long trips. If you need to charge in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional USB-PD compatible AC adapter.
Crystal clear hands-free calling
With Precise Voice Pickup Technology & advanced audio signal processing, the person on the other end of the call will hear your voice clearly, even when you are in noisy situations. Equipped with two beamforming microphones on each earcup, these headphones are calibrated to only pick up your voice.
All day comfort with an elegant design
These lightweight headphones are beautifully finished in newly developed soft fit leather. This material fits snugly around the head with less pressure on the ears while keeping out external sounds. The stepless slider, seamless swivel and hanger, and silent joints, makes it a pleasure to wear.
Multipoint connection
These headphones can be paired with two Bluetooth devices at the same time. So when a call comes in, your headphones know which device is ringing and connects to the right one automatically. You’ll also be able to quickly switch your headphones to either of the two devices at the touch of a button.
